Problem statement

Create a Kubernetes cron job that pulls node metrics like (CPU, Memory, Disk usage) and stores them in a file.

Every time the cron runs, it should create a new file. The filename should have the current timestamp.
By default, cron should be minute, but it should be configurable with the slightest changes to code.
Choose a tool of your choice to collect and expose metrics. Preferable is node exporter.
The instances involved here are Kubernetes nodes themselves.
Expected Output:

The actual program code pulls the metrics and writes them to a file.
The Dockerfile to containerize the code.
Kubernetes YAML or HELM Chart.
A README file explaining the design, deployment and other details.
If possible, record a short video to demo the output with the code files.
Note :

Pick the choice of your language to write the cron job. Preferable is bash.
Treat the output files generated as essential and should be retained on pod restarts.
Deployment can either be Kube yamls, helm charts, kustomize.
You can make necessary assumptions if required and document them.
Choose local kubernetes setup like minikube, kind. Other option is to pick any cloud platform's kubernetes flavour.
